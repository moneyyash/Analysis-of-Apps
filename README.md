# Recommendation-of-Apps
In this project , I analyse the dataset of of  android apps and iOS apps of different category and try to predict which type of app should developer should make so that  it can attract more users  or in other words company can earn more profits.
As of September 2018, approximately 2 milion iOS apps available on App Store and 2.1 million apps available on Google Play.
We use two datasets 
1.  https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps  containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018
2. https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017.
